Introduction
------------

The Python scripts in this directory can be used to translate Artisan
exports into XMI readable by Papyrus.

To use the tool, it is first necessary to unzip the export generated by
Artisan. Next, the tool can be invoked in two different ways:

1. To list the packages present in the export, invoke the tool with:

       ./xmi_trans.py list Model

   where GenerisIIq should be replaced by the directory containing the
   export to the translated.

2. To translate the export, invoke the tool with:

       ./xmi_trans.py generate Model "Functional requirements"

   where Model should again be replaced by the directory containing
   the export. The last argument is optional and denotes the package to be
   translated (in this case "Functional requirements"); the package should
   be one of the packages listed by the list functionality.

Dependencies
------------

The tool depends on Python 2, version 2.5 or higher; Python 3 is not
supported. In addition the following external libraries are required:

* ply, python lex-yacc:

  We tested with version 3.4.

* pyth, python text markup and conversion:

  Currently only the latest version from the pyth git repository works. The
  repository is located at:
