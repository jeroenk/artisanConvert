Introduction
------------

The Python scripts in this directory can be used to convert Artisan UML
exports into XMI readable by Papyrus. Currently only state machines are
converted.

The tool can be invoked in two different ways:

1. To list the packages present in the export, invoke the tool with:

       ./xmi_trans.py list Model.zip

   where Model.zip should be replaced by the zip-file containing the
   export to the translated.

2. To convert the export, invoke the tool with:

       ./xmi_trans.py generate Model.zip "Functional requirements"

   where Model.zip should again be replaced by the zip-file containing
   the export. The last argument is optional and denotes the package to be
   translated (in this case "Functional requirements"); the package should
   be one of the packages listed by the list functionality.

Dependencies
------------

The tool depends on Python 2, version 2.5 or higher; Python 3 is not
supported. In addition, the following external libraries are required:

* ply, python lex-yacc:

  We tested with version 3.4.

* pyth, python text markup and conversion:

  Currently only the latest version from the following clone of the pyth git
  repository works:
